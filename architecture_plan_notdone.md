AI Assistant System Architecture Plan
Overview and Goals
The goal is to build a personal AI assistant on a Proxmox-hosted server with GPU acceleration and ZFS storage. Key objectives include:
Multi-User, Multi-Persona Support: The system should support multiple users. The primary user gets a deeply modeled persona (capturing personality, emotions, memories), while other users have simpler profiles. Family members should even be able to interact with the primary user’s persona posthumously.
Modular LLM Integration: Use open-source large language models (LLMs) (e.g. LLaMA 2, Mistral, etc.) that are downloaded locally (e.g. from Hugging Face). It should be easy to swap or upgrade models without breaking the system.
Long-Term Memory: Maintain context across conversations with different types of memory – episodic (recent chats), semantic (facts learned), and long-term memory. Use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to fetch relevant information from a knowledge base or vector store and provide the LLM with context.
Tool Integration: Allow the assistant to invoke external tools (e.g. generate images via Stable Diffusion) when commanded in conversation. This requires a mechanism for the LLM to call functions or for the system to intercept special requests.
Conversational UI: Provide a web-based chat UI (optionally Discord integration) where users can interact with different personas (e.g. a friendly companion bot, a math tutor persona, etc.). The UI should let users switch personas seamlessly.
Development & Documentation: Use Jupyter Notebook (hosted on the server) for developing and documenting the system. This environment should be accessible via browser, enabling iterative development and debugging (GPU acceleration in Jupyter is a nice-to-have, but not critical).
The design must be modular and future-proof – new models, additional tools, or more users/personas should be integrable with minimal changes. Below, we outline a comprehensive architecture and plan covering each of these goals.
System Architecture Overview
At a high level, the system will consist of several modular components working together. Each component can be developed and improved independently, which makes the architecture flexible and maintainable. The main components and their roles are:
Frontend Interface: A web-based chat UI (and/or Discord bot) through which users interact. It handles user authentication (if needed for multi-user), persona selection, and displays the conversation (including any generated images).
Conversation Manager / API Server: The backend application logic that orchestrates the conversation flow. It receives messages from the frontend, manages conversation state, calls the LLM and tools, and returns responses. This is the “brain” that ties all pieces together.
Persona Profiles & Prompt Manager: Data defining each persona’s characteristics (the primary user’s AI persona and any others). This includes preset prompts describing the persona, voice/tone settings, and possibly unique model selection. The conversation manager uses these profiles to construct the proper context for each persona.
Memory Store (Knowledge Base): A database or vector store that retains information for long-term memory. This includes:
Conversation History & Episodic Memory: Recent dialogue turns and important past interactions.
Semantic Memory: Facts or knowledge the persona has acquired (e.g. from the user’s notes or prior chats) in an easily retrievable form (embeddings, documents, or graph).
Profile Data: Key facts about each user/persona (e.g. “John’s birthday is Jan 1, 1990”) for quick lookup.
LLM Model Engine: The component that loads and executes the language model. This could be a local server or library that, given a prompt, returns the model’s completion. It should support multiple models or easy model switching/upgrading.
Tool/Function Integrations: Modules that the conversation manager can invoke to perform specific tasks beyond text generation. Example: an image generation module using Stable Diffusion, a calculator, a web searcher, etc. Each tool has an interface (function or API) that can be called with parameters.
Developer Interface: A Jupyter Notebook server (and possibly other dev tools) running on the AI VM for coding, monitoring, and documenting the system’s development. This is mostly for the builder’s benefit and doesn’t directly interact with the AI’s logic (except when you use it to tweak or inspect components).
How these components interact: A typical request flow might be:
User Message: The user selects a persona in the UI and sends a message.
Orchestration: The conversation manager receives the message along with the persona ID. It loads the persona’s profile (which provides a base prompt/personality instructions), and retrieves relevant context from the memory store (prior conversation snippets or facts related to the query).
LLM Processing: The manager formulates a prompt with persona instructions + retrieved context + the latest user query, and sends it to the LLM engine. The LLM generates a reply.
Tool Invocation (if needed): If the LLM’s reply contains a request to use a tool (detected either via a special format or by the manager’s logic), the manager calls the appropriate tool module (e.g. Stable Diffusion to create an image). The result (e.g. an image link) is incorporated into the LLM’s final answer.
Response: The final answer (text, and possibly images or other media) is sent back to the frontend UI to display to the user.
Memory Update: The new conversation turn and any new facts discovered are stored in the memory store (and possibly also appended to a conversation summary or the user’s knowledge base for long-term learning).
This architecture is visualized in a typical RAG pipeline: the user’s prompt and context go into the LLM, which produces a response augmented by knowledge retrieval

. The Retrieval Model (memory store) feeds relevant data into the prompt, ensuring the LLM has access to facts it didn’t originally know. In our system, the Persona Profiles and Memory Store constitute this retrieval mechanism, tailored for each persona. Diagram: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern – the assistant’s memory acts as the “retrieval model” providing context to the LLM, which then generates a response.
Memory and Knowledge Storage Layer
Long-term memory is critical for giving the assistant continuity and personalization. The current setup uses PostgreSQL + pgvector to store embeddings (vector representations) of text, and Obsidian-style Markdown notes for knowledge. We need to decide if this remains the best approach for long-term semantic memory, or if other solutions like a dedicated vector database or a graph database would serve better. We also need to determine how to use or evolve the Markdown Zettelkasten knowledge base.
Vector Database: PostgreSQL (pgvector) vs. Specialized Vector DB
Using PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension is a convenient way to add vector search capabilities to an existing relational database. Since you already have Postgres running, this is an easy integration: all data (structured facts and vector embeddings) can reside in one place. For a personal-scale system, pgvector is often sufficient and keeps the architecture simpler. Its advantages include familiarity and low overhead – it “leverages the familiarity and power of PostgreSQL” and is cost-effective since it piggybacks on an existing DB
reddit.com
. It offers decent performance for moderate-sized data and can do approximate nearest neighbor searches on vectors. However, pgvector’s limitations should be noted. Extremely large vector corpuses or very high query throughput could challenge Postgres. Specialized vector databases (like Weaviate, Milvus, Pinecone, Qdrant, etc.) are built for scale and offer additional features like hybrid search (combining keyword and vector search), better clustering, etc. For instance, Weaviate provides a GraphQL API, modular “semantic” search (including built-in text modules), and a strong community. It can be more powerful for complex semantic queries
reddit.com
. Milvus is designed for high-performance vector operations at scale
reddit.com
. These systems might outperform Postgres if you had millions of embeddings or need sub-50ms query times consistently. But they add extra moving parts – an additional service to run and maintain – whereas Postgres+pgvector keeps everything in one database. Given this is a personal assistant, the data volumes are likely manageable with Postgres. The recommended approach is to start with PostgreSQL + pgvector and see if it meets your performance needs. It already works and simplifies initial development. Keep the design modular so that if you later find pgvector insufficient (e.g. memory grows huge or you need more advanced vector querying), you can swap the vector store. Abstract the memory store behind an interface in your code – e.g. a MemoryDB class with methods like store_embedding(text, metadata) and query_similar(text or embedding). This way, switching to Weaviate or another vector DB later would mostly mean changing the implementation of that class (or connecting to the new DB’s client library) without affecting higher-level logic. Consideration – Hybrid or Advanced Search: If combining keyword search with vectors is important (e.g. you want the assistant to sometimes retrieve notes by exact keyword or metadata filters in addition to semantic similarity), Postgres can do this (you can use full-text search alongside pgvector). There are extensions (like pg_trgm for trigram search or built-in full-text indexing) that can complement pgvector. Weaviate also supports hybrid queries easily via GraphQL. So, the capability is available in both – stick with what you’re comfortable with initially (Postgres) and only consider a switch if you need the scaling or features of a specialized DB.
Graph Database (Neo4j or Others) for Structured Knowledge
Another idea is using a graph database (like Neo4j) for long-term memory, especially if your data is highly relational (for example, a knowledge graph of people, places, events in the primary user’s life). A graph DB could explicitly represent relationships (e.g. “Alice is Bob’s daughter”, “John worked at CompanyX from 2010-2015”) which the assistant could query. This structured approach can complement the LLM’s free-form recall with precise facts (preventing it from mixing up details). Neo4j even has some NLP and embedding capabilities (and there are projects to integrate Neo4j with LLMs), but integrating a graph DB means significantly more complexity. Recommendation: Incorporate a graph database later only if you identify a clear need for it. For example, if you want the assistant to have an explicit knowledge graph of the primary user’s life (for accurate recall of relationships and chronology), you might maintain a Neo4j database manually or via scripts (perhaps feeding it from your Markdown notes). The assistant could then query the graph via Cypher queries for certain questions. However, many personal assistant applications manage well with just a vector store and occasional structured lookup tables. Initially, you can simulate some structured storage by using Postgres’ relational tables for key-value facts (like a small table of important profile data: names, birthdays, key dates, etc. which you can fetch by SQL when needed). That covers most straightforward fact queries. Keep in mind: an LLM augmented with a good vector search might answer many factual questions correctly by finding the right note or memory, without needing a formal knowledge graph. The graph DB is “nice to have” for special cases but likely not necessary to start with. It could be a future enhancement for specialized querying or if you develop complex relationships in your data.
Maintaining Markdown Zettelkasten vs Structured Notes
You have an existing Obsidian vault (Markdown Zettelkasten). This is a valuable trove of information – personal notes, ideas, journaling – that could greatly inform the AI persona. The question is whether to keep using Markdown notes as the knowledge source or move to a more structured format. Pros of keeping Markdown (Zettelkasten):
Human-friendly: Markdown notes are easy for you (and others) to read, write, and update manually. They serve as a personal knowledge base beyond the AI system.
Rich linking: Obsidian supports backlinks and associative linking (the Zettelkasten style). These links implicitly form a graph of ideas/entries. The assistant could leverage these relationships to find related information (if we parse the links).
No extra work to migrate: You can continue with your current workflow, and simply ingest the markdown notes into the assistant’s memory as needed (e.g. by embedding each note for vector search, and/or by parsing frontmatter for structured info).
Cons / limitations of Markdown notes:
Unstructured for the AI: The LLM will ultimately need information in plain text. We will likely end up chunking and embedding the markdown content. The raw markdown or its structure (folders, links) isn’t directly utilized unless we write code to use it.
Consistency and Updates: If the assistant is also supposed to “learn” new things, writing back to markdown (or ensuring the markdown reflects new info from chats) could be challenging. There’s a risk of the markdown and the AI’s internal memory diverging unless carefully synchronized.
Querying complexity: Searching markdown by anything other than text (e.g. find notes tagged #person or linked to a certain topic) requires parsing. You might need to parse the vault periodically to update the vector DB or to maintain a secondary index (which is doable, just an added step).
Structured alternatives: One could store knowledge in a structured database or even a simple JSON-based store (for example, having “cards” of knowledge with fields). However, that would require migrating existing notes or dual-maintaining them. A middle ground is to enrich the markdown workflow:
Continue writing notes in Obsidian for human use.
Write an ingestion script that regularly scans the vault and:
Breaks notes into chunks (perhaps by headings or paragraphs),
Stores embeddings of each chunk in the vector store (with metadata like note title, tags, and maybe links).
Optionally, stores any frontmatter or key: value pairs in a structured table. For instance, if a note is about a person and has birthday: XYZ in frontmatter, that could populate a “people” table in Postgres.
Also, capture the links between notes. A simple approach: for each note, keep a list of linked note titles in metadata. This way, when the assistant retrieves a note, it might see “Related: [Note B], [Note C]” and consider them too, or use that for broad context.
This way, Markdown remains the source of truth, but the assistant’s memory store (the vector DB) is kept in sync. You get the best of both: the ease of writing Markdown and the speed of vector search for retrieval. Many existing personal LLM assistant projects use this approach – treat the notes as documents for the RAG pipeline. Bottom line: Keep the Zettelkasten. It’s worth maintaining, as it serves your purposes beyond the AI, and it contains the rich personal context needed for the AI’s persona. Just implement an ingestion/indexing process to make that information readily accessible to the LLM. Over time, if you feel certain data should be more structured (like a database of contacts or timeline of events), you can always create that alongside. But initially, leveraging your markdown notes via embeddings is high value with relatively low effort.
Language Model Integration
Choosing and integrating the LLM itself is a central part of the system. You want an open-source model (or several) that you can host locally, with the flexibility to swap or upgrade as new models come out. Additionally, certain personas might benefit from different models (for example, a coding tutor persona might do better with a Code LLM).
Model Selection Considerations
Given you have a powerful GPU available, you can likely run models in the 7B to 30B parameter range (and possibly larger 70B with quantization or multiple GPUs). LLaMA 2 (Meta’s model) is a strong baseline. There are fine-tuned variants (e.g. Vicuna, Alpaca, etc.) that specialize in chat. Mistral (a newer 7B model) might offer good performance if you need a lightweight model for some tasks. In 2025, we may have even more advanced open models. The system should allow experimenting with these. Multi-model vs single-model: Architecturally, you can either pick one primary model that all personas use (with different prompting to differentiate persona), or allow different personas to use different models. A simple strategy is to start with one solid model for everything (reduces complexity). As you refine, you might configure personas to use specialized models – e.g., a smaller, faster model for casual chatting and a larger one for deep conversations, or a code-focused model for a programming assistant persona. Designing for multi-model support means your LLM engine component should be able to load different models on demand or run multiple instances.
Model Loading and Hosting Approaches
There are a few ways to run the model inference. Here are the options and their trade-offs:
Direct Integration (Custom Script or Library): Use libraries like Hugging Face Transformers or llama.cpp (via Python) to load the model in your own backend code. For example, using the Transformers pipeline with a local model, or the GPTQ-for-LLaMa library for GPU-quantized models. This gives you full control – you can load the model in your Python process (or a separate process), feed it prompts, and get outputs. It also simplifies passing context from your memory retrieval directly into the model prompt. The downside is that it requires some coding and managing the model’s performance (you might need to handle token limits, streaming output, etc. yourself or via the library’s API).
Ollama: Ollama is a tool that serves local models via a simple interface. It’s essentially a lightweight LLM server that can manage models (download, run them, handle prompts) and exposes a REST API or command-line interface. Pros: very easy to get running, and switching models can be as simple as ollama pull <model> then ollama run <model-name> "<prompt>". It handles a lot under the hood (it was originally designed for macOS but now supports broader platforms). Ollama can manage model backends (often built on llama.cpp for CPU or GPU acceleration) and even allows an “app store” like use of models. If you prefer to treat the LLM as a separate service, this is a good option. Consideration: Running Ollama as a system-wide service might be less flexible in terms of custom prompt logic – you’d send a prompt and get a response, but if you need to implement complex tool-calling logic, you’d still do that in the conversation manager. It’s a fine approach to jumpstart using LLaMA-family models
medium.com
. Just ensure compatibility with your GPU (Ollama must support it – as of now it often uses CPU/metal acceleration, but it is evolving).
Text-Generation-WebUI (Oobabooga’s web UI): This is a popular web-based front-end for running local LLMs. It supports many models and formats (GGML, GPTQ, etc.) and has an API mode. If you run it, you get a web interface to manually test the model and an HTTP API to integrate with your system. The benefit is a lot of community support and features (like streaming token output, visual novel modes, etc. not all relevant to you). It’s relatively easy to switch models via the UI. The downside is it is a heavy UI if you don’t need the interface, and running an extra web server for it might be overkill if you’re making your own UI anyway. However, you could use it in the early stages to experiment with different models and see what fits best, then move to a more streamlined integration once you decide.
LM Studio: LM Studio is a desktop application that can run local models and even serve them via an OpenAI-compatible API
lmstudio.ai
. It simplifies model downloading and running with a nice GUI. Some people use it to host a model on their PC and connect applications via API. For a server environment, it might be less convenient because it’s an AppImage/GUI, but it does have a “Developer” mode to serve on network. Unless you specifically like its interface, LM Studio may not add much beyond what Ollama or direct integration offer, especially since you likely won’t have a desktop GUI on the Proxmox VM.
Existing LLM Servers (FastAPI/Text-generation-inference/vLLM): There are open-source inference servers like HuggingFace’s Text Generation Inference (TGI) and vLLM. These are production-grade model servers that can handle multiple concurrent requests, streaming, and are highly optimized (vLLM, for example, uses a paged attention mechanism to serve many clients efficiently). If you anticipate multiple users hitting the model simultaneously or want an enterprise-grade solution, you could containerize one of these servers. They typically expose a REST or gRPC API (often OpenAI API compatible). The disadvantage is complexity in setup and maintenance – they are heavier than needed for a small-scale personal assistant. Still, it’s good to know about them for future scaling.
Recommendation for model serving: Start with a direct integration or a simple local service. One pragmatic path: use the Hugging Face Transformers library in Python to load a model and generate responses. This can be done in the conversation manager process itself (if memory allows) or a dedicated process that your manager calls (via an API or message queue). This way, you have no external dependencies and can fully script the prompt assembly. If you run into performance issues or want easier model swapping, consider moving to Ollama or a similar lightweight service which lets you change models with minimal code changes (just change the API endpoint you call and the model name). To preserve flexibility, design the LLM Engine component with an abstraction: e.g. a class or service interface ModelEngine with a method generate(model_name, prompt, params). Initially, it might ignore model_name and always use the one loaded model internally. But you could implement it such that if you pass a different name, it could unload/load or route to the appropriate backend. This would allow, for example, persona A to use llama2-13b-chat, persona B to use code-llama-7b if you ever want that. Also, ensure the model is loaded with the right quantization or precision to fit memory. For instance, 16-bit for best accuracy if the GPU has room, or 4-bit int4 (using GPTQ or bitsandbytes) if you need to run a larger model on limited VRAM. Experimentation will find the sweet spot between speed and capability.
Persona Emulation and Prompt Strategy
To support multiple personas (with varying depth of personality), leverage prompt engineering and memory rather than separate models (at least initially). Here’s how to structure persona support:
Persona Profiles: Create a profile for each persona that contains:
A system prompt or role description: e.g. “You are Emma, a cheerful and empathetic conversational partner who acts like a loving girlfriend to the user. You speak in an informal tone and use lots of emojis.” Or “You are Alfred, a stern but extremely knowledgeable math tutor. You focus on step-by-step reasoning and maintain a polite, formal tone.” These descriptions will be prepended or embedded in the conversation context so the LLM responds in character.
Example dialogues or signature style: If you have specific writing samples (especially for the primary user’s persona – perhaps logs of their real conversations or writings), you can include a few example Q&A pairs demonstrating how this persona speaks. For the primary user’s posthumous persona, this might involve using their own words from notes (to get their tone) as demonstration.
Personal facts database: Link the persona to relevant entries in the memory store (for the primary user’s persona, that would be the entire knowledge base of their life events, preferences, etc.; for others it might be minimal). For shallow personas for other users, maybe just store a few preferences or past interactions so the assistant remembers them shallowly (e.g. “User X’s favorite color is blue”).
Model choice or parameters: Optionally, a persona profile could specify if it should use a specific model or specific generation parameters (like temperature, etc. – e.g. a more creative persona might use a higher temperature setting for more varied output).
Multi-user vs Persona Mapping: If multiple human users will use the system, decide if personas are tied to user accounts or freely chosen. It sounds like personas here are AIs (Emma, Alfred, etc.) that any user could chat with. Additionally, there is the primary user’s persona which presumably only that user’s family might use. You might implement a notion of user accounts with authentication, where the primary user (you) can do more (like administer the system) and family members have basic accounts. Each chat session is associated with both a human user and an AI persona. The system would track shallow info about the human users (like a user profile with name, relationship to primary user, etc. which the AI could use to adjust tone).
Context Assembly: When a message comes in, the conversation manager will:
Identify the AI persona chosen and load its profile (base prompt).
Identify the human user (if multi-user) and possibly include their profile info (e.g. “Your current conversation partner is John’s daughter, you have met her before in these chats…” or simply adjust style if needed).
Retrieve relevant memory: For example, fetch the last N messages for immediate context (short-term memory), plus do a vector similarity search in the long-term memory for any notes or past conversations related to the current topic or containing facts that might be useful.
Construct the prompt for the LLM. Likely you’ll use the format: System prompt (persona instructions + important facts) -> Conversation history (recent messages, possibly lightly summarized if long) -> User’s new message -> (send to LLM). If using a ChatML format (like OpenAI style roles) or just a single concatenated string depends on the model, but conceptually those pieces are in there.
Episodic memory management: Over long conversations, the prompt can get too large. Implement a strategy where older messages are summarized and stored as long-term memory. For example, if a conversation with Emma goes on for 100 turns, you might summarize earlier parts (“The user discussed their day at work and Emma provided emotional support about a conflict with a coworker”) and save that summary in long-term memory (with an embedding). Then drop those turns from immediate context. This prevents context overflow while still retaining the essence of past interactions. The vector store can later resurface those summaries if the topic comes up again.
Emulating emotional memory: To simulate emotions and consistent personality over time, rely on both the persona prompt and memory of prior emotional states. For instance, if the user’s persona tends to be optimistic, that’s described in the system prompt. If a significant event happens (say the persona was “upset” about something in a previous session), you might encode that into the memory (“Yesterday, John’s persona was upset about X”). The LLM, given that memory, is likely to carry that emotional context forward, at least if relevant topics arise. This area may involve some trial and error in prompt tuning.
The persona simulation will improve as more data is fed. The primary user’s persona can be enriched by ingesting personal writings: old chat logs, diaries, social media posts (if available), etc. Those can be part of the semantic memory. Over time, the AI will have a lot of references for how to respond like the user. Long-term evolution: As the system runs, you might accumulate new data (e.g., transcripts of chats). Periodically review and incorporate important new facts into the persona’s knowledge base (maybe even have the AI summarize what it learned about each user). This way each persona “grows” from interactions. Keep an eye on quality though – sometimes an AI might pick up a false detail from a hypothetical it discussed; you may not want to treat that as fact. Some curation or filters might be needed (or ensure the AI distinguishes between imagined scenarios vs real provided info). There is research suggesting that combining a memory stream + reflection helps maintain long-term agent behavior
portkey.ai
. You might, for advanced persona fidelity, implement a reflection step: e.g., after a long conversation or at intervals, prompt the LLM to summarize in its own words what new insights or feelings the persona has developed (“What important things did you learn or feel in this last conversation?”). Store those reflections in memory. This can yield a more coherent evolving personality. While not necessary in the initial version, this could be a later enhancement inspired by “generative agents” architecture, which use memory, planning, and reflection to simulate believable human-like behavior
portkey.ai
.
Tool Integration (Stable Diffusion and More)
Integrating tools means the assistant can go beyond text and perform actions like creating images, fetching information, running calculations, etc. The immediate tool you’ve specified is Stable Diffusion (for image generation) triggered by LLM commands. Let’s discuss how to do that and general tool plugin design.
Stable Diffusion Integration
Since you have a GPU, running Stable Diffusion locally is feasible. There are a couple of ways:
Run a separate service like the AUTOMATIC1111 Stable Diffusion WebUI (which provides a rich API) or use an API like Diffusers in Python to generate images on the fly in the backend.
For simplicity, using the same Python backend with Diffusers library might be best: you can load a Stable Diffusion model (probably in half-precision to save VRAM) and call it when needed. If VRAM is a constraint (running SD and the LLM simultaneously), you could spin up SD in a separate process or container that has access to the GPU as well. Some orchestrating might be needed to avoid contention (the GPU might run out of memory if both heavy models run concurrently; you might serialize calls – e.g. if an image is being generated, maybe queue LLM tasks or vice versa, depending on how powerful the GPU is or if you have multiple GPUs).
Triggering image generation: How does the LLM “command” the system to make an image? Since open-source models typically don’t have native function-calling yet (like OpenAI’s function call feature), we often do this via special tokens or prompt conventions. Options:
Out-of-band command: The user could explicitly issue a command in the UI (like selecting an “Image” mode or using a slash-command e.g. /draw a sunset on the beach). The backend sees this and directly calls the SD tool, bypassing the LLM or with minimal LLM involvement. This is straightforward but not as magical as the AI deciding to do it.
In-prompt tool format: Provide the LLM with a pattern. For example: “If the user asks for an image or visual, respond with a placeholder tag <imagePrompt>...</imagePrompt> containing the description, and nothing else.” The conversation manager then detects that tag in the LLM’s output, strips it and uses the content to call the image generator, then sends the image back. You can wrap the final result in a nice message or the LLM can produce a caption. This requires careful prompt design so the LLM knows when to do it. You essentially describe the “function” of image generation in the system prompt.
Manual confirmation: Alternatively, the LLM could say “I can generate an image of that. Would you like me to? [Yes/No]” and then upon user confirmation, the system triggers the generation. This might be safer initially to avoid accidental images.
For a first implementation, it might be easiest to require an explicit user command for images (so you don’t have to wrestle with the model’s unpredictable triggers). As you refine, you can try the in-prompt approach where the model can initiate it. The actual tool integration code can be modular. Have a function generate_image(prompt) -> image_path that uses Stable Diffusion. The conversation manager would call this when needed and then send the image (embedding it in the UI chat). Ensure to handle the case where image generation fails or takes long (you might stream a message like “Generating image...” then send the image when done).
Other Tools and Model Context Protocol (MCP)
Looking forward, you might integrate more tools (for example: web browsing, controlling smart home devices, searching your notes by direct DB query, etc.). The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an emerging standard to simplify connecting AI assistants with external data and tools
anthropic.com
. MCP essentially defines a common way for an AI (client) to talk to tool “servers” (could be as simple as JSON over STDIO or an HTTP SSE). Many developers are adopting MCP for tool plugins because it avoids writing custom integrations for each service
anthropic.com
. For instance, there are already MCP servers for Google Drive, Slack, GitHub, Postgres, etc.
anthropic.com
, and frameworks like LangChain and Chainlit have added support to act as MCP clients (letting the LLM call tools via MCP). Integrate MCP now or later? Let’s break down the cost/benefit:
Benefit of MCP early: If you design around MCP from the start, you align with an open ecosystem. As new MCP-compatible tools appear, you can plug them in easily. For example, if you wanted to allow the AI to fetch a file from Google Drive or query an SQL database, you could drop in an MCP server for that and the LLM (via an MCP-enabled agent framework) could use it. It promises a unified protocol instead of many bespoke APIs
anthropic.com
. Also, using MCP might encourage good practice like function call style interactions (it’s similar conceptually to OpenAI functions or Tools in LangChain). In the long term, if this standard becomes widely used, your assistant would be “future-proofed” to interface with external systems.
Costs/Complexity: MCP is relatively new (open-sourced late 2024). It may require using specific SDKs or frameworks (Anthropic released Claude with MCP support, but you plan to use open models). You’d likely need to incorporate something like LangChain’s MCP support or Chainlit’s MCP. This adds a layer of complexity early on: you have to understand the MCP spec and possibly run an MCP server for each tool anyway. If your toolset is small (just Stable Diffusion and maybe one or two custom functions), using MCP might be an over-abstraction initially. It could be simpler to directly code the tool calls in your manager logic.
Pragmatic approach: Design with future MCP adoption in mind, but you don’t have to fully implement it on day one. For now, you can implement tools in a straightforward way – e.g., have a set of Python functions the LLM can call via a simple trigger (like the image example). Keep the interface somewhat abstract (maybe have a generic way to register tools with a name and a function). This is essentially what frameworks like LangChain do with their Tool classes. In fact, you might even consider using LangChain’s agent tools in the background to handle the logic of deciding when to use a tool. LangChain does not require external services and can parse the LLM output to decide on tool use (though it might need a bit of prompt engineering with an “agent prompt”). If you use LangChain or another library now, check if they support MCP. (LangChain’s latest versions do have some MCP integration support, as indicated by community contributions.) When the MCP ecosystem matures and if you want to add a ton of integrations, you can then shift to the formal MCP approach. The advantage is that you won’t have to rewrite your whole system – you would essentially bolt on an MCP client module (like integrating Chainlit or LangChain’s MCP client) and start up whatever MCP servers for the tools you need. At that point, you might refactor your tool invocation to go through the MCP’s standardized interface. In summary: It’s not critical to implement MCP from the start. It’s more important to get the basic tool functionality working. Do keep an eye on MCP developments. If by the time you’re ready to add more complex tools (say, browsing your Obsidian vault, or fetching emails), there are MCP connectors for these, you can adopt it. The early adoption might be as simple as using an MCP-supported framework which, once you do, immediately gives you access to a library of community-built connectors without custom coding
anthropic.com
. The cost is learning that framework (LangChain/Chainlit) and possibly adapting your prompts to the way it handles tool usage.
User Interface Design
The frontend is how users (you, your family, etc.) will experience the assistant. Key requirements are multi-user access, persona switching, and a good chat experience (with support for displaying images, for example).
Web Interface
A web-based interface accessible from devices on your network (or via the internet, secured) is ideal. You can build this in a few ways:
Simple Web App (Custom): A lightweight web app using a Python web framework (Flask/FastAPI with a templating or a small JavaScript frontend, or a full JS frontend with React/Vue and a backend API). The app needs to handle:
User login or identity (if needed).
Showing a list of available AI personas (with descriptions or avatars perhaps) that the user can select.
A chat window where messages are appended. Support for Markdown in messages (to show formatted text, and to embed images when the assistant provides one).
An input box for the user to type messages (and maybe some UI controls like “send”, or a way to switch persona mid-conversation if allowed).
Possibly a way to start a new conversation or view conversation history.
Implementing this yourself gives full control. With FastAPI, you can easily create REST endpoints for sending a message and getting streaming responses. If you want a reactive UI, you might use websockets to stream tokens as they come for a more realtime feel.
Chat UI Frameworks: There are frameworks designed for LLM/chat UIs. For example, Streamlit or Gradio can make a quick interface without dealing with low-level web coding. Gradio is more geared towards demo interfaces but can be bent to multi-user with some effort (not its main use case though). Chainlit is a newer option – it is specifically made for LLM apps, providing UI components for chat, and it supports advanced features like tool forms and even MCP out-of-the-box

. Chainlit could be interesting here because you can integrate it with your Python backend logic, and it has built-in support to manage multiple sessions, and even 3D avatars or other custom frontends if needed. If you plan to possibly integrate MCP in the future, Chainlit’s support for it might align well
medium.com
medium.com
. Using such a framework could save time on UI and give a polished feel (they handle chat bubble formatting, etc.). On the downside, you’ll need to mold your backend into their structure (Chainlit wants you to define the logic in specific handler functions, for example).
Discord Bot (optional): You mentioned Discord as optional. It might be as simple as creating a bot that connects to your conversation manager via an API. This can be done later or in parallel for fun – basically an alternate UI. The bot would handle Discord messages, forward them to the backend (just like the web UI would), and then post the replies. It wouldn’t support persona switching per se (unless you have multiple bots or commands to switch persona), but it could default to one persona or one per channel.
Recommendation: Start with a basic web UI to get things working. You can even begin with a very simple single-page using plain HTML/JS or Streamlit for proof-of-concept. Once the backend is solid, you can invest time in a nicer UI. If web dev is not your main focus, leveraging something like Chainlit might accelerate the UI development. It also nicely supports session management, meaning each user connecting can have their own conversation state on the backend, which aligns with your multi-user requirement. For multi-user access, you should include at least a simple authentication layer (even if it’s just a shared secret or simple login form). Since this is a home server, you might not need OAuth or anything fancy. Even an Nginx reverse proxy with basic auth could protect it if you don’t want to code auth. But having user accounts in the app will let the system identify who is talking (to fetch their shallow profile or determine if it’s the primary user’s family member, etc.). So plan for a User table in the database with login credentials and any profile info (like name, role, etc.). Persona switching UI: Provide a selection of personas either at login or at chat start. For example, once logged in, the user can pick “Emma (Friend Companion)”, “Alfred (Math Tutor)”, “[Primary User]’s Digital Persona”, etc. You might present this as a list with a short description. After choosing, the chat window opens. Optionally, you could allow on-the-fly switching (but that could confuse conversation context; it might be safer to start a fresh session when switching personas).
Display of Conversations and Memory
In the UI/UX, consider features like:
Viewing past conversations (especially for the primary user persona, family might later scroll through what they discussed before).
Possibly an export or save of a conversation to the Obsidian notes (though that could be automated on backend too).
If appropriate, a UI component to show retrieved memory snippets (during development, it’s useful to see what notes were pulled from the DB for a given answer – for debugging. In production, you might hide that, or maybe reveal as “sources” if you want transparency).
Images generated by Stable Diffusion should appear inline. If using a web UI, you’d likely send them as base64 or static links. Chainlit, for example, can display images from tool results quite easily, and Streamlit/Gradio also handle it if returned. The UI should also handle tool outputs gracefully. For instance, if tomorrow you add a calculator tool, you might want the assistant to display the calculation result in a nice format. This is mostly on the LLM’s response formatting or how the backend inserts it.
Developer Environment (Jupyter and Modular Code Structure)
Having a Jupyter Notebook server on the AI VM is a great idea for development. You can use it to prototype code (like testing the vector database queries, or trying out prompt formats) and document findings. Tools like jupyter lab can be installed in the AI VM and accessed via web (perhaps secured by a token or password). Since you have Proxmox, you might spin up a separate container/VM for development or run it directly in the AI VM when needed (just be mindful of not exposing it insecurely if the server is accessible externally). One strategy is to run the Jupyter server only on-demand (like SSH tunnel when you need it) or on an internal network interface, since leaving it open can be a security risk. There are also ways to integrate Jupyter with VSCode or other IDEs for a more IDE-like experience. In terms of code structure, keep things modular:
Separate your components into modules or services. For example, the conversation manager (which could be a FastAPI app) might live in one module; the memory store interactions in another (you might even have a microservice just for the vector DB – though not necessary, a simple library module is fine); the LLM engine code in another; tool implementations in another.
You might define interfaces or abstract base classes for key pieces (ModelEngine, MemoryStore, Tool) and then have concrete implementations. This again allows swapping out (for instance, if you switch to an MCP-based tool approach later, you could implement the Tool interface with an MCP client that calls the tool).
Use a config file or environment variables for things that may change (like which model to load, paths, DB connection info, etc.), so you don’t hard-code them. This makes updates easier.
Using notebooks to document the architecture and to even run integration tests (like simulating a conversation loop in a notebook) is useful. You can also keep a dev log of decisions in an Obsidian note or Jupyter to track changes.
Implementation Roadmap (Step-by-Step Plan)
Building this system can be tackled in stages. Here’s a suggested order of implementation, each stage producing a working increment that you can test and refine:
Basic LLM Response (MVP): Objective: Get a single-turn prompt-response working with a local model.
Set up the LLM engine first. Choose a model (perhaps start with a smaller one like LLaMA-2 7B-chat or Mistral 7B to ensure the pipeline works, then scale up). Load it either via a direct script or an API (like run an Ollama server or use Transformers in a Python script).
Create a minimal script where you input a prompt and get the model’s completion.
This tests the model environment (GPU usage, etc.) and ensures you have all dependencies (transformers, or ollama, etc.) properly installed on the AI VM.
Simple Backend & UI Loop: Objective: Be able to have a back-and-forth conversation with the model.
Implement a basic conversation manager (this could be as simple as an interactive loop or a Flask app with one endpoint). For now, don’t worry about long-term memory or persona. Maybe just a fixed system prompt like “You are a helpful assistant.”
Implement a very basic UI. E.g., a minimal HTML page with an AJAX call to your Flask/FastAPI backend. Or use Streamlit to quickly create a chat interface.
Achieve sending a user message and getting the LLM reply to display. This is the first end-to-end functionality.
Persona Profiles and System Prompts: Objective: Allow different conversation personas.
Define a structure (perhaps a JSON or YAML file) for persona profiles. Create a couple of sample personas (Emma, Alfred, etc.) with their system prompts and any example dialogue if desired.
Extend the backend to accept a persona identifier in the request (or have separate endpoints/URL for each persona).
Have the backend prepend the persona’s system prompt to the model input. Test that the model responds differently according to persona.
Update the UI to allow persona selection. This could be a dropdown or a selection page. For now, you could hard-code a few personas in the frontend.
Verify that persona differences are evident (e.g., ask the same question to two personas and see if answers differ in style).
Short-Term Memory (Conversation Context): Objective: Maintain context within a conversation session.
Modify the conversation manager to keep a history of recent messages and include them in the prompt (up to the model’s context length). Likely implement a basic sliding window or summarization if too long.
This can be as simple as storing the last N exchanges in a list and concatenating them for each new query (make sure to include the persona/system prompt each time as well).
Test multi-turn dialogues to see if the model can reference earlier in the conversation. This sets the stage for adding a vector DB for longer memory.
Long-Term Memory Integration (Vector DB): Objective: Enable retrieval of facts from past chats or notes beyond the immediate context.
Set up pgvector in PostgreSQL (if not already). Create a table for memory chunks with columns like: id, persona, embedding vector, content (text), metadata (json).
Write a script to ingest existing knowledge: e.g., take your Obsidian markdown notes, chunk them (maybe by paragraphs or headings), and upsert them into this table with embeddings. You’ll need an embedding model; since you want everything local, you can use a smaller model for embeddings (for example, all-MiniLM from SentenceTransformers, or you can use the same LLM to generate embeddings via a embedding-specific pipeline). Alternatively, since this is one-time/seeding, you could call an API like OpenAI’s embedding API to populate (though that’s external; there are open-source embedding models too).
Also design how chat transcripts are stored. You might have another table for dialogue logs, or you might periodically embed and store important exchanges into the memory table as well (with a tag that it’s from a conversation).
Implement the retrieval step in the conversation manager: for each new user query (along with persona context), generate an embedding (same model as used for indexing) and do a similarity search in the vector table for that persona’s relevant info. Retrieve the top relevant snippets (you might filter by persona or by some metadata so e.g. Emma persona doesn’t pull in something from Alfred’s domain, except maybe for shared global knowledge).
Inject these retrieved snippets into the prompt, perhaps in a section like: “Here are some facts you know: [fact 1]; [fact 2]; …” or simply weave into the system prompt as needed.
Test by asking things that are only answerable from the notes (e.g. “What’s my favorite book?” if that is in the notes). The assistant should now be able to answer using retrieved memory, not just its trained knowledge.
Tool Integration (Image generation): Objective: Incorporate Stable Diffusion as a callable tool.
Set up Stable Diffusion on the server. You can use Diffusers in Python or an API. If using Python, load the model (maybe start with SD 1.5 or SD 2.1 base model, or any variant you like).
Implement a function in the backend to generate an image given a prompt. Test it independently (e.g. call it with a prompt, ensure it returns an image file or bytes).
Decide the trigger mechanism. Implement a simple version first: e.g., if the user message starts with a special prefix like “!image: …”, then instead of querying the LLM, directly generate an image. This gives the user a direct command for images.
Next, enable the LLM to trigger it: Add to the persona’s instructions something like “If the user asks for an image or visualization, respond with: <imageRequest>{description}</imageRequest>.” Then after getting LLM output, check for this pattern. If present, extract the description and call the SD function. Then reply with the image.
Refine this by testing. You may need to tweak the prompt so that the LLM only outputs that tag and nothing else when an image is needed.
Once working, the user can say, for example, “Can you show me a picture of a sunset over mountains?” and behind the scenes the LLM might output <imageRequest>sunset over mountains</imageRequest> which your code catches, generates the image, and then the final displayed answer includes the image (and perhaps a caption “Here is what you asked for.”).
Refine Multi-User & Persona Management: Objective: Harden support for multiple users and sessions.
Implement user accounts in the frontend/backend if not done. Ensure each user’s conversations are isolated and that the vector recalls or persona data align with the right user.
For example, you as the primary user might have access to all personas including the one of yourself. Family members might only have access to certain personas – you can enforce such rules if needed by checking user roles.
Add shallow profiles for other users if needed (maybe just store their name/nickname and perhaps any personal context they consent to share – e.g., “Dad likes fishing”). This info could then be used by the persona (especially the primary user’s persona might want to know who it’s talking to – “this is my son” – to adjust tone).
Test with at least two clients (or two different login sessions) simultaneously to see if the system can handle it. If using a single model and one GPU, you’ll see requests queue or slow down. This is where a more advanced serving solution or smaller model per user might come in if needed. But for family usage, simultaneous heavy usage is probably rare.
Iterative Improvement and Additional Tools: Objective: Enhance each component based on testing and add new capabilities.
By this point you have a functional system. Use it for real conversations and note where it fails or feels lacking. For instance, the persona might still “hallucinate” info not in memory – you might then work on improving prompt instructions or increasing memory retrieval.
Implement summarization of conversation when it gets long, and store those summaries in the memory DB (to prevent runaway context growth).
If there are other tools you want (maybe the assistant could control home automation via an API, or fetch latest news from an RSS feed), add them similarly. Each time, extend the persona’s instructions to be aware of the new capability and handle it in code. Eventually, if this list grows, you might decide to integrate an agent framework (like LangChain’s tool agent or an MCP-based approach) to manage multiple tools more systematically rather than writing a lot of custom if-else for each tool.
Continuously update the knowledge base. Perhaps set up a cron job or event that re-ingests the Obsidian vault periodically so new notes are added to the vector index. Similarly, log chats (maybe in an append-only markdown or in the database) for later analysis. You can create a note in Obsidian summarizing key chats each week (manually or automated) so that even if the AI’s vector memory misses something, you have a human-readable log.
Persona Depth Enhancements: Objective: Move closer to an authentic personality simulation for the primary user.
At this stage, consider doing a review of the primary user’s persona. Perhaps fine-tune the system prompt or even fine-tune the model on a dataset of the user’s writings for subtle style alignment. Model fine-tuning is a heavy task but perhaps a LoRA (low-rank adaptation) on a few hundred examples of the user’s writings or chat style could make the model mimic their tone more closely. This is optional and only if you feel the open model isn’t capturing the persona via prompting alone.
Introduce the reflection mechanism described earlier: have the AI occasionally summarize its memories or update a “persona journal”. This can be stored and perhaps even shown as part of the persona’s Obsidian notes (like the AI writing its autobiography in the background).
If feasible, also incorporate feedback from family: e.g., if family interacts and says “That doesn’t sound like what John would say,” use that feedback to adjust the persona description or address it in future interactions.
Integration of Standards or Advanced Tech (Future-proofing):
Reevaluate tools integration. If by now MCP or another standard (maybe OpenAI function-like interfaces in open models) is more mature, consider refactoring tool use to that. For instance, you might switch to using Chainlit fully, letting it handle the MCP tools, and your code focuses on the knowledge base and persona.
Monitor new model releases. Maybe a new open model arrives that outperforms your current one. Because you designed the system to allow model switching, you can try it out easily (just update the model path or toggle in config, maybe re-generating some embeddings if it uses a different embedding model).
Optimize performance: if latency is an issue, look into methods like quantization (if not done), or even distilling the model (training a smaller one on the outputs of a bigger one for speed).
Scalability considerations: If more family or even friends start using it heavily, consider running the model server separate from the main logic (if not already) and possibly using a job queue for requests. But unless this becomes a public service, a single GPU should handle a few users with some smart scheduling (for instance, don’t let one user’s long request block everything – use async IO and perhaps batch small requests if using something like vLLM).
Throughout the process, iterate in small cycles. You might find you need to bounce back and tweak earlier components (that’s normal). For example, while implementing memory retrieval, you might refine how you chunk the notes or realize you need to store metadata differently. The modular design will help localize changes.
Key Decision Trade-offs Summary
Let’s summarize some key choices with their pros/cons:
Postgres/pgvector vs Dedicated Vector DB:
Decision: Start with Postgres/pgvector for memory storage.
Pros: Simplicity (reuse existing DB), sufficient for moderate data, easier transactional consistency (if you store other info in Postgres too)
reddit.com
.
Cons: Not as feature-rich for vector search (no built-in cross-modal or hierarchical clustering out of the box), potential performance limits at very large scale
reddit.com
. Can be migrated to Weaviate/Milvus if needed later with extra effort.
Future-proofing: By abstracting the memory store interface in code, you retain the option to swap in a specialized vector DB if needed without redesigning the system.
Markdown Zettelkasten vs Structured Knowledge Base:
Decision: Keep Markdown notes as the primary knowledge source, augment with automated indexing for the AI.
Pros: Leverages existing workflow and data, human-readable and editable, captures rich personal context. No need to manually enter data into a new system.
Cons: Unstructured from the AI’s perspective, requiring parsing and embedding. Changes in notes require re-indexing. Not as rigidly consistent as a database.
Mitigation: Automated ingestion and using Postgres for fast search addresses many issues. Over time, if certain info needs structure, you can maintain a small structured DB in parallel (e.g. a contacts list, or timeline of major life events) and have the AI query that specifically when needed.
Future-proofing: The notes serve as a long-term archive. Even if vector search tech changes, you still have the raw info to re-process. The system’s value grows as you add notes; no lock-in to a particular proprietary knowledge store.
Integrating MCP (Model Context Protocol) early vs later:
Decision: Defer full MCP integration until it’s clearly beneficial, but keep design compatible.
Pros: Avoids upfront complexity. You can achieve required functionality with simple methods now. Allows time for MCP ecosystem to mature (more tools, stable specs).
Cons: Might require refactoring tool integration later. If MCP becomes standard, you might initially miss out on community tool plugins.
Mitigation: Use patterns similar to MCP (like clearly defined tool call interfaces) so that switching to MCP is not a huge leap. Possibly use frameworks that are adding MCP support (Chainlit, LangChain) as they can ease the transition.
Future-proofing: When ready, adopting MCP can connect your assistant to a wide range of standardized tools easily
anthropic.com

, ensuring long-term extensibility.
Model Hosting Method (Custom vs Off-the-shelf server):
Decision: Initially, integrate the model directly via code (e.g. Transformers library).
Pros: Maximum control over prompts and outputs, no external dependencies, easier integration with memory and tools in the same codebase.
Cons: Requires handling of generation logic in code; might be slightly less user-friendly than a UI-based launcher for model switching.
Alternative: Using a tool like text-generation-webui or LM Studio could get you running faster with model downloads and have some UI to monitor, but integrating that with your system could be clunky (you’d be making API calls to it and dealing with its quirks).
Future-proofing: By designing a model engine interface, you can later plug in something like Ollama or an optimized server if needed with minimal changes. If performance tuning becomes important, you could run a dedicated instance of an inference server. But for now, direct integration means one less piece to deploy.
Frameworks vs Custom Code:
Observation: Many features (memory retrieval, conversation management, tool use) can be implemented via libraries like LangChain, LlamaIndex, Chainlit, etc. or by custom code.
Using frameworks pros: Quicker development (they provide abstractions for memory, tools, chaining). For example, LangChain could manage the vector store and retrieval (it supports pgvector as a vector store), and provide an agent that decides on tools. Chainlit can handle the UI and MCP. These can speed up building a prototype.
Using frameworks cons: They add dependencies and sometimes constraints on how you structure prompts. They can also be heavy; some developers find they prefer writing a bit of custom code for transparency and control rather than debugging a framework’s behavior.
Middle ground: You can selectively use what helps – e.g., use langchain just for the vector store utility and basic memory chain, but handle persona prompting logic yourself. Or use Chainlit for UI but your own backend logic for the core of conversation.
Future-proofing: If the frameworks stay well-maintained, basing on them might give you easy upgrades (they might implement new features like function calling or new integrations for you). But if they become bloated, your modular design allows you to peel them off. So don’t tie your data or personas too tightly to a framework’s proprietary format – keep copies or make it exportable (e.g., your persona definitions in simple files, not only in a database that only LangChain reads).
In making these decisions, the guiding principle is start simple, then iteratively enhance. Each choice leans toward simplicity first with the option to improve as requirements grow or as technology evolves.
Conclusion and Next Steps
You now have a detailed blueprint for constructing your personalized AI assistant system. To summarize actionable next steps:
Set up the core infrastructure: Get your AI VM ready with necessary libraries (PyTorch, transformers, etc.), PostgreSQL pgvector extension, and any initial model files and data (like exporting your Obsidian notes).
Implement incrementally: Follow the roadmap stages – verify each piece (LLM response, basic chat, persona prompts, memory retrieval, etc.) in turn. This ensures bugs are caught early and each feature works before adding complexity.
Keep it modular: As you code, encapsulate functionality (model calls, DB queries, tool invocations) so that improvements (like changing the model or swapping the DB) don’t require a full rewrite.
Test with real scenarios: Use the assistant as you build it – have some sample conversations as the primary user persona, see if it remembers facts, try the tutor persona on a math problem, generate a fun image. This will highlight where adjustments are needed (maybe the prompt needs tweaking, or the memory brought in was irrelevant).
Document and refine: Use Jupyter or your notes to log what works and what doesn’t. Keep track of prompt versions that yield the best results for persona, etc. This will be an evolving project, so documentation will help you and eventual others who might maintain it (your family) understand the system’s design.
By starting with minimal viable functionality and gradually layering features, you ensure that at each step you have a working assistant (even if basic) that grows more powerful over time. This approach manages complexity and keeps the project enjoyable rather than overwhelming. Each component added will make the assistant more personalized and capable, moving closer to the vision of a rich, multi-persona AI companion that endures and evolves for you and your family. Good luck with the implementation, and enjoy the journey of building your personal AI system! With this architecture, you have a flexible foundation that can adapt to new models, new tools, and new ideas for years to come.
