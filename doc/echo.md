# Echo Simulation

The long-term goal of the framework is to support the creation of a **digital echo** — a persona that reflects the user's language, preferences, tone, and personality. This can be used to simulate a person’s responses or retain their “voice” over time.

## What Is an Echo?

An Echo is a model or simulation that:

- Mimics the user’s speaking/writing style
- Remembers their preferences and values
- Responds to new input in a way the user *would have*
- Can continue conversations even if the original user is no longer present

---

## Why Echo?

- To preserve personal memories, style, and personality
- To simulate responses from a user in the future
- To support emotionally intelligent agents that learn over years

---

## Echo Corpus (Training Data)

User data is incrementally stored in:

```
data/echo_corpus/user_<id>/
├── logs.jsonl          # User messages
├── facts.json          # Extracted facts and values
├── traits.json         # Personality and tone
├── sessions/           # Full historical chat sessions
```

This corpus is used to:

- Simulate the user via LLM prompting
- Fine-tune small local models (optional)
- Compare future inputs to “Echo personality”

## Echo Modes

| Mode        | How It Works                              | When to Use        |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Prompt Echo | Inject facts + traits into the system prompt | Early phase (now)  |
| Embedding Echo | Match response style using user’s vector profile | Mid-term           |
| Fine-tuned Echo | Train a distilled LLM clone on user corpus | Long-term (optional) |

---

## Simulation Example

Prompt injection:

```
You are simulating the personality of Anthony.
Tone: witty and sarcastic.
Values: honesty, loyalty, football.
Likes: dogs, Manchester United. Dislikes: Tottenham.

Answer in Anthony’s voice.
```

User:  
> “What do you think of Tottenham?”

Echo:  
> “A constant disappointment — like ordering coffee and getting decaf.”

---

## Future Directions

- Allow "Echo" agents to operate independently
- Enable family/friends to chat with someone's Echo after loss
- Allow multiple user echoes to collaborate or debate

---

## Ethics

Echo simulation is an **opt-in** feature and should never be done without user awareness and consent. The goal is to empower users, not replicate them without control.
